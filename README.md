# stockTracker
This repository can help you to track Indian stock market. The code uses an python library called bseIndia to get live prices from the BSE, later on compares it with the values provided and sends a mail if the price goes above target price or goes below stoploss price.
Just download the repository and run the file named "main.py".(python main.py).
It may take some time when you run it for the first time, as it downloads all the required data in "file.pkl" so that it can access it later. 
Sometimes shortforms of the stock names won't work, so try searching full names.
